# Scripts

This is a collection of Scripts which I use to do things automatically. One-time or ad-hoc scripts will be added to the one-time folder. 

Currently the scripts do the following.

## create_react_native_project.sh

Creates a React Native project with an accompanying github repo for it all in one command, adding the correct remote link and naming conventions. After running it will output a line with a link to the repo.
